            <p><b><u>Agricultural engineering</u></b> also known as <b><u>agricultural and biosystems engineering</u></b></p>
            <p><b>Agricultural enginnering</b> is the <mark>  study and application of engineering science and designs principles for  purposes, combining the various disciplines of mechanical, civil, electrical, food science, environmental, software, and chemical engineering to improve the efficiency of farms and agribusiness</mark></p>
                <p>An<u><b>  Agricultural engineer</b></u> is an engineer with an <q>agriculture background.</q> Agricultural engineers make the engineering designs and plans in an agricultural project, usually in partnership with an agriculturist who is more proficient in farming and agricultural science.</p>
